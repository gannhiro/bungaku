# Privacy Policy for bungaku

### Effective Date: September 19, 2025

This privacy policy applies to the bungaku mobile application (hereby referred to as "the Application") created by gannhiro as an open-source service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".
Our goal is to be as transparent as possible about user privacy. Our core principle is to collect no personal information through the Application itself.

## Information Collection and Use

As of the effective date of this policy, the bungaku Application does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal data from its users. The Application does not include any analytics, tracking frameworks, or user account systems.

### Third-Party Service Provider: Mangadex

The Application's core functionality is provided by Mangadex, which acts as the service provider for all content. The Application communicates directly with the public Mangadex API.
When you use the Application to browse, search for, or read manga, your device sends requests to Mangadex's servers. As a result, Mangadex will receive information necessary to process these requests, which includes:
 - Your device's IP address.
 - Your usage data (e.g., which manga or chapters you access).

We do not control how Mangadex collects or uses this data. We strongly encourage you to review their privacy policy to understand their practices: https://forums.mangadex.org/help/privacy-policy/

### Mature Content & Age Requirement

The Application provides access to content from the Mangadex library, which includes works that are intended for a mature audience and may be considered Not Safe For Work (NSFW).
The Application is intended for use only by individuals who are of legal age to view such material in their local jurisdiction (typically 18 years or older). By using bungaku, you affirm that you meet this age requirement.

### Changes to This Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy may be updated in the future. We will notify you of any changes by updating this page. You are advised to consult this policy periodically for any changes, as continued use is deemed approval of all changes.
